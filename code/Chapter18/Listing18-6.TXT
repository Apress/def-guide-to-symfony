Listing 18-6 - Preparing an Array in the Action Is Useless If You Already Have One


// In the action
$articles = ArticlePeer::doSelect(new Criteria());
$titles = array();
foreach ($articles as $article)
{
  $titles[] = $article->getTitle();
}
$this->titles = $titles;

// In the template
<ul>
<?php foreach ($titles as $title): ?>
  <li><?php echo $title ?></li>
<?php endforeach; ?>
</ul>
