Listing 6-14 - Using `preExecute`, `postExecute`, and Custom Methods in an Action Class


class mymoduleActions extends sfActions
{
  public function preExecute()
  {
    // The code inserted here is executed at the beginning of each action call
    ...
  }

  public function executeIndex()
  {
    ...
  }

  public function executeList()
  {
    ...
    $this->myCustomMethod();  // Methods of the action class are accessible
  }

  public function postExecute()
  {
    // The code inserted here is executed at the end of each action call
    ...
  }

  protected function myCustomMethod()
  {
    // You can also add your own methods, as long as they don't start with "execute"
    // In that case, it's better to declare them as protected or private
    ...
  }
}
